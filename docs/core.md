# Core Architecture Overview

This document provides an overview of the core architecture of our application. The application is designed to be scalable, efficient, and maintainable, leveraging several modern technologies and best practices.

## Technologies Used

1. **Express**: A fast, unopinionated, minimalist web framework for Node.js, used for building the server-side application.
2. **TypeScript**: A statically typed superset of JavaScript that enhances code quality and maintainability.
3. **Prisma**: An ORM (Object-Relational Mapping) tool used as a database wrapper on top of a PostgreSQL server, facilitating database interactions.
4. **Docker**: A platform used to containerize the application, ensuring consistency across different environments and simplifying deployment.
5. **BullMQ**: A robust library for handling asynchronous operations, enabling efficient background processing.
6. **Redis**: An in-memory data structure store used as a cache and a messaging queue to enhance performance and manage asynchronous tasks.
7. **Elasticsearch**: A distributed search and analytics engine used to optimize read queries and can also be utilized as a logging mechanism.

## Architecture Components

### 1. Express Application

The core of the application is built using Express. It serves as the main framework for handling HTTP requests, routing, middleware, and response handling. The application structure follows a modular approach, separating different concerns into controllers, services, and middleware.

### 2. TypeScript Integration

TypeScript is used throughout the application to provide type safety, which helps in catching errors during development and improves the overall maintainability of the codebase. TypeScript enables developers to use modern JavaScript features while ensuring compatibility and reliability.

### 3. Prisma ORM

Prisma is used as the primary tool for database interactions. It provides an abstraction layer over the PostgreSQL database, simplifying complex SQL queries and database operations. Prisma's schema-driven development approach ensures that database schema and application models are always in sync.

#### Key Features:

-   **Schema Management**: Define and manage your database schema in a Prisma schema file.
-   **Type Safety**: Generate TypeScript types for your database models, ensuring type safety.
-   **Migrations**: Automatically generate and run database migrations.

### 4. PostgreSQL

PostgreSQL serves as the primary relational database for the application. It is known for its robustness, extensibility, and support for complex queries. The database stores all persistent data, including user information, application state, and transactional data.

### 5. Docker

Docker is used to containerize the entire application, including the database, Redis, and Elasticsearch. Containerization ensures that the application runs consistently across different environments, from development to production.

#### Key Benefits:

-   **Isolation**: Each component runs in its own container, isolated from others.
-   **Consistency**: Ensure the same environment in development, testing, and production.
-   **Scalability**: Easily scale individual components as needed.

### 6. BullMQ

BullMQ is used for handling asynchronous operations, which are crucial for tasks that need to be processed in the background. This includes operations like sending emails, processing files, and other long-running tasks.

#### Key Features:

-   **Queues**: Define and manage queues for different types of tasks.
-   **Workers**: Process tasks asynchronously using worker processes.
-   **Scheduling**: Schedule tasks to be executed at specific times.

### 7. Redis

Redis acts as both a cache and a messaging queue in our architecture. As a cache, it stores frequently accessed data in memory to reduce database load and improve response times. As a messaging queue, it temporarily stores tasks to be processed asynchronously by BullMQ.

#### Key Features:

-   **In-Memory Storage**: Fast access to cached data.
-   **Pub/Sub Messaging**: Efficiently handle messaging between different parts of the application.
-   **Persistence**: Supports data persistence for critical information.

### 8. Elasticsearch

Elasticsearch is integrated into the application to optimize read queries and provide advanced search capabilities. It indexes data from the PostgreSQL database, enabling fast and efficient search operations. Additionally, Elasticsearch can be used as a logging mechanism to analyze application logs and monitor performance.

#### Key Features:

-   **Full-Text Search**: Powerful search capabilities for querying large datasets.
-   **Analytics**: Real-time analytics on indexed data.
-   **Scalability**: Handle large volumes of data with ease.

## Workflow and Interaction

1. **Client Requests**: Clients interact with the application through HTTP requests handled by the Express server.
2. **Database Operations**: Prisma ORM translates application queries into SQL queries, interacting with the PostgreSQL database.
3. **Caching**: Redis stores frequently accessed data to improve response times and reduce database load.
4. **Background Processing**: BullMQ manages background tasks, using Redis as a queue for task management.
5. **Search and Analytics**: Elasticsearch indexes data from PostgreSQL and handles optimized search queries and analytics.
6. **Container Management**: Docker ensures each component runs in an isolated, consistent environment.
